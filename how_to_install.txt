1 - Make sure npm and stuff is available. Best way of achieving this is by using Fork.
2 - Unpack "7z.zip", "python.7z" and "rcedit.zip" inside static_bins
3 - Unpack "node_modules.7z" from "static_bins" to "app"
4 - Create "release" folder in the root dir if it doesn't exist already
5 - To avoid re-compiling the entire controller every time - patches exist.
    A base is compiled (which never really changes) and then patches
    only containing actual code are applied on the said base.
    
    Everything is 100% automated.
    Simply look for the corresponding .cmd files inside "install" folder.
    (python installed system-wide is required)
    Compiled results are placed into "release" folder.
    To apply a patch - drag-n-drop the root folder of the installed base onto the patch .exe
    
    Bases are completely standalone. It's totally possible to have multiple controllers installed
    in different folders.


6 - The javascript code is pre-processed by python scripts before being fed to the app.
    The pre-processor script is called "bootlegger", it's available on github.
    
    To make it work it's required to download the bootlegger repository anywhere
    and execute bootlegger.py with one single parameter: Path to the compile config.
    https://github.com/MrKleiner/bootlegger

    The config is located at "app/src/compiler_conf.json".
    It's also required to change the "project" key in the config
    to absolute path pointing to "app/src"

7 - To reload scripts on runtime it's required to run bootlegger (which only takes a second or two)
    And then press ctrl+r inside the controller.


8 - To build a base it's required to first compile it with npm itself.
    Open console through Fork in the context of the current repository.
    type "cd app"
    Then, type "npm run make" and wait for it to finish.
    Lastly, look for a self-explanatory .cmd file in the "install" folder.


9 - To launch the app for testing - Open console through Fork in the context of the current repository.
    Then, type "cd app",
    Afterwards, type "npm run start" and wait for the controller to open.
