How to use:
	- Launch vmix_emulator.exe
	- Do what is asked of you (Enter target port), press Enter (on your keyboard)
	- Use controller as you normally would

This emulator does absolutely nothing.
It's simply a dark void to plummet requests into.

The only special feature is:
/API?function=
Will return a sample project, as VMIX normally would
(with a number of inputs, overlays turned on, videos and so on)
