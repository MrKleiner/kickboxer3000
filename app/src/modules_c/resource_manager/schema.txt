Resource manager rotates around title files
and resources having different versions/revisions.

It could be so that a titling session requires
a slightly edited version of the same title
as before.

OR a single GT title having multiple revisions,
fixes and whatever the fucknot.

All of this combined with easier organization
and pushing content to vmix.

Pushing content to vmix:
Creating a single file (archive/payload) of all the content
needed for the current titling session.
And then adding all of that to VMIX with a single button push.
